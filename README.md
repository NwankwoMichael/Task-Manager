# Task Manager

A responsive JavaScript Task Manager built from scratch to practice and solidify the **MVC (Model–View–Controller)** architecture.  
This project represents a milestone in my learning journey — it’s where the concept of MVC finally clicked for me.

## ✨ Features

- Add, toggle, and delete tasks
- Bulk actions (mark all completed, delete all)
- Empty state message when no tasks exist
- Accessible icon buttons with `aria-label`s
- Responsive layout with flexbox
- Clean separation of concerns using MVC
- Persistent storage with localStorage

## 🚀 Motivation

> "All it takes is the idea first, then the courage to think of the logic, and finally one code at a time."

This project reflects my current JavaScript skillset. Every feature was implemented with logic I fully understand, ensuring the app is both functional and a true representation of my growth.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, custom properties)
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

## 📚 Lessons Learned

- MVC architecture finally made sense in practice
- Importance of accessibility (`aria-label`, focus states)
- Handling empty states for better UX
- Structuring code for clarity and maintainability
- Using localStorage for persistence

## 📦 Future Improvements

- Task fade-out animations on delete
- Filter-specific empty state messages
- **Edit Task Text**: allow inline editing of a task’s description
- **Categories or Filters**: let users filter tasks by priority or category
